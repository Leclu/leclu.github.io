      <p>I am a college freshman majoring in ESD/IT in s' Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands. I currently work as a courier but am looking to land a job in IT, either as a network manager or device repair technician.</p>
      <p>I have always been interested about the inner & inter works of computers. Both the insides of machines, and the connection between them. I used to take apart my PlayStation 2's when I was a child, being fascinated by all the confusing parts of it. This expanded into building PC's and helping my family & friends with their computers. When it comes to software, I am mainly interested in web-development. I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This site might not look like much, but the minimal styling was done on purpose; I am in love with "bad" front-end.</p>
      <p>When it comes to games, I find myself usually playing stuff like Dark Souls and Breath of the Wild. I have spent WAY too many hours in both, amounts that would certainly disappoint my dad if he saw it. I will digress from talking about my hours in Minecraft. Apart from that, I also play Counter-Strike 2, Brawlhalla and Quaver.</p>
