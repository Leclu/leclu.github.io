            Oh, hi there. I'm Leclu, I'm 18 years old, and from the Netherlands. I am a tech enthusiast, you know, working on hardware, doing network stuff and spending half the day doing some coding. And, well, I also spend way too much time gaming. especially stuff like Dark Souls and the Legend of Zelda. But, yeah, that's pretty much me, in a nutshell
        </p>

        <h2>I like networking and coding.</h2>
        <p>
            I have always been interested about the inner & inter works of computers. Both the insides of machines, and the connection between them. When it comes to software, I am mainly interested in web-development. I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This site is entirely done by me as a "First Actual Project" after doing a shit load of tiny, unfinished projects.
        </p>
        <h2>Gamingâ„¢</h2>
        <p>
            When it comes to games, I find myself usually playing stuff like Dark Souls and Breath of the Wild. I have spent WAY too many hours in both, amounts that would certainly disappoint my dad if he saw it. I will digress from talking about my hours in Minecraft. Apart from that, I also casually play CS2, Brawlhalla and Quaver.
        </p>
