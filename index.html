        <p>I am a college freshman majoring in ESD/IT in s' Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands. I currently work as a courier but am looking to land a job in IT, either as programmer or hardware guy.</p>
        <p>Apart from that, I have always been interested about the inner & inter works of computers. Both the insides of machines, and the connection between them. When it comes to software, I am mainly interested in web-development. I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This site is entirely done by me as a "First Actual Project" after doing a shit load of tiny, unfinished projects.</p>
        <p>When it comes to games, I find myself usually playing stuff like Dark Souls and Breath of the Wild. I have spent WAY too many hours in both, amounts that would certainly disappoint my dad if he saw it. I will digress from talking about my hours in Minecraft. Apart from that, I also casually play CS2, Brawlhalla and Quaver.</p>
