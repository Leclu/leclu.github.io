        <p>As a college freshman in 's-Hertogenbosch, Netherlands, I'm diving into ESD/IT studies while simultaneously working as a courier. My eyes are set on snagging an IT role—maybe as a network manager or diving into device repairs.</p>
        <p>My fascination with computers goes way back. I used to break down my PlayStation 2, trying to understand its insides. That early curiosity led me to build PCs and help out friends with their tech problems. When it comes to software, I'm all about web development—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are my tools. And my website? It might seem bare, but that minimalist look? Totally intentional.</p>
        <p>And about gaming,  Dark Souls and Breath of the Wild? They've eaten up a rather good chunk of my time. Minecraft...let's just say it has its own timezone in my life. And for some casual fun, I hop into Counter-Strike 2, Brawlhalla, or vibe with Quaver.And about gaming,  Dark Souls and Breath of the Wild? They've eaten up a rather good chunk of my time.
