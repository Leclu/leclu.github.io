        <p>Oh! uh.. hello there! I am Leclu. I am a Dutch tech enthusiast emerging from the epic province of Gelderland. I mostly work with hardware and like to hoard data. I am often found picking apart computers or modding games, which doesn't go very well... But, having fun is what counts, right? :3</p>
        <p>My experience with computers goes back quite far. I had been gifted a PlayStation 2 for my 4th birthday, and not even a year of owning it I took it apart because I decided it would be a good idea to find out why there was a ribbon under the disc. That expanded into helping my grandma with her PC, and eventually that snowballed into helping my entire family with various issues. I am currently attending college in hardware & networks in 's-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands, after spending 17 years in pre-college hell.</p>
        <p>Apart from tech-related stuff, I also like to play games such as Breath of the Wild and Dark Souls. I like to sing, which I barely ever do unless my best mate forces me to join in on a verse, but I'll get there. I also like to program, which is why I made this website! I know it doesn't look like fucking coding jesus made it, but that is because I really dislike unnecessary front-end stuff.</p>
        <p>That's about it. If you'd like to contact me you can press the buttons below. Thank you for reading, I really appreciate it. ^-^</p>
