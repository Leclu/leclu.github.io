        <p>
            Oh, hi there. I'm Leclu, I'm 18 years old. I'm kind of an IT enthusiast, you know, working on network stuff and doing some coding. I'm from the Netherlands. And, well, I guess you could say I'm also really into gaming, especially stuff like Dark Souls. But, yeah, that's pretty much me, in a nutshell
        </p>

        <h2>üåê Networks Are My Jam</h2>
        <p>
            There's something oddly fascinating about how all these digital connections work, and I'm all about optimizing and securing them. It's like my secret world.
        </p>
        <h2>üíª Coding's My Thing</h2>
        <p>
            I like creating websites, and I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for that. It's like an outlet where I let my creative side loose.
        </p>
        <h2>üéÆ Gaming, Anyone?</h2>
        <p>
            When I need a break from all the tech mumbo-jumbo (or life in general.), I disappear into gaming. Dark Souls I, Dark Souls II, and Dark Souls III give me a thrilling challenge whilst also fascinating me with the medieval, yet utterly beautiful setting, and I also dig Need for Speed: Most Wanted's thrilling cop chases. Oh, and I enjoy the quieter vibes of Terraria and Minecraft too.
        </p>
        <p>If you'd like to play with me, shoot me a message on Discord, or even Steam if you prefer. The circle-shaped images in the section above this one will take you to my profiles.</p>
